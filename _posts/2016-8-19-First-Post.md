## What did you do this past week?

This past week in class We had our introduction and begun to learn the inital steps for professional software development. However mostly I have been getting used to being back at school after a long summer away. Over the summer I interned as a software developer so I have been keeping busy but school still requires a slightly different mindset.

## Whatâ€™s in your way?

During my multiple internships I have picked up a few of the development tools that we are using for this class, but there are still many more that I have to learn. I am encountering issues with Travis CI having to do with access to my Private Repos on Github and I am not sure how to solve it. Problems like these are especially frustrating because the answer is often very dificult to solve, because you as a programmer might not have directly caused it.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I will begin to actually write the code for our first project, as well as return to work for the company I interned with. For our first project I am going to start with getting Travis CI to work as well as setting up a development environment on my Mac that I like to use. A comfortable development environment is very important to me when developing. I developed on a windows computer this last summer and I never really felt quite comportable which added a level of discomfort to the process that I felt didnt need to be there.

## Personal Reactions to class

Class this week was rather simple as we mostly went over the basic details of the class. However, I did learn about a few developemnt tools that I had never heard of which made me realize that there is not only much programming knowledge for me to learn, but also development knowledge. The distinction being the coding itself, and the practice of turning that piece of code into production level code.

## Tip Of The Week

My tip for this week would definitely be to start the project as early as possible. I have already run into multiple issues with the development tools we are using which have taken more time that I expected. It is important to get started early because issues like this can just pop up, and it is important to be able to deal with them early on, so the meat of the project can be given the attention it deserveres.
