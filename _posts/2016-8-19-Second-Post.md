title: Week of Sept. 4th

## What did you do this past week?

This past week in class We begun to learn more about unit testing and other helpful software development practices, as well as learning more python tips and tricks. We also read a signifigant amount about Extreme Programming and begun to get a good idea of what exactly it is and how it works. Out side of class I really got going on my first project. After finishing up setting everything up last week This week I finished writing the actual algorithm and begun to work on the unit tests.

## Whatâ€™s in your way?

I have had multiple interships in which I have developed professional quality Web Apps for multiple companies, but during that time I have never written any unit tests or done any official testing of any kind. So getting used to writing unit tests and other sorts of tests is alien to me. The other thing that is iin my way is getting used to tracking all of my feautres and bugs using issues. I have been using git for quite a while now but I have never really taken advantage of githubs systems.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I will finish up the first project. I will submit the code into sphere and finish up writing all of the tests. I am interested to see what happens when I first submit my code into sphere. I set up a cache which during testing improved the speed by an incredible amount, but in my opinion the cache is not that well designed so I am not sure its going to go as well as I hope.

## Personal Reactions to class

This week of class was relatively uneventful as we are still in the middle of project 1, but also not far enough into the semester to have gotten into any of the more meaty material. As I said last week though, I am still picking up more and more software development techniques. I really like learning more about Software development theory and more in depth about the individual roles of the customer, and programmer in the relationship.

## Tip Of The Week

My tip for this week would definitely be to just get as involved in the technologies as possible. For instance wihth git, really try to get to know how the technolgy works and what it is capable of. I thought I lost some code, but upon careful inspection of git I was able to do some trickery and get it back. All of our tools are very powerful and have a lot of potential.
